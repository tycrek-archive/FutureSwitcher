# FutureSwitcher
Profile switching tool for Future Client

## How to use

1. Install Java (project is built and tested with Java 8 but should work fine with later versions)
2. Download the latest `.jar` from [Releases](https://github.com/tycrek/FutureSwitcher/releases/)
3. Set up your Future profiles (see below)
4. Run the `.jar` file by double-clicking it
5. Click the **Import** button to import your Future profiles
6. Click on any Future profile to load it
7. If it was successful, type `.reload` in Minecraft chat to load the profile

## Setting up Future profiles

1. Future configs are stored in your user folder. On Windows this is usually `C:\Users\YourUsername`
2. Do steps 3-5 to build your profiles
3. In Minecraft, build your desired config using the Future GUI and commands
4. When you are done, type `.save` into chat
5. In your user profile, **copy** the folder `Future/` and rename the new one to what the profile is for, e.x. `Future PVP/`


## Tips

- If you make changes in-game and want to switch profiles, make sure you set up a profile if you want to keep these changes. FutureSwitcher **will overwrite** anything in `Future/`!
